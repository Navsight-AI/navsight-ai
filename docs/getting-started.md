To get started, you’ll need:

### 1. Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi** (preferably Pi 4 for better performance)
- **Camera module** (Pi Camera or USB webcam)
- **Speaker or headphones** (for audio feedback)
- **MicroSD card** (with Raspberry Pi OS installed)

### 2. Software & Libraries
- **Python 3** (pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS)
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`) for image processing and camera interfacing
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for object detection models (TensorFlow Lite is recommended for Pi)
- **Text-to-Speech** library (e.g., `pyttsx3`, `espeak`, or `gTTS`)
- **NumPy** for numerical operations

### 3. Features Implementation
- **Object Detection:** Use a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet SSD, YOLOv5 Nano, or TensorFlow Lite models) for real-time detection.
- **Audio Feedback:** Use a TTS library to announce detected object properties (e.g., “Red cup detected in the center”).
- **Optimizations:** Use lightweight models and optimize code for Raspberry Pi’s limited resources.

### 4. Example requirements.txt
```
opencv-python
numpy
pyttsx3
tflite-runtime
```

### 5. Additional Tips
- Test your code on your PC first, then deploy to the Raspberry Pi.
- Use the Pi’s GPIO pins if you want to add buttons or other hardware controls.
